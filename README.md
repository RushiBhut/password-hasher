# password-hasher
This is a password hasher that I created for a school research project. I researched different methods of securing websites and one important method is using hashed passwords. I created a login and register form where you can register a username and password. The username and a hashed version of the password are stored in a csv file. Every time a user tries to login, the password is hashed again to compare the login attempt with the csv file.
